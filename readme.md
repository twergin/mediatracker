This is a media tracking app built with Angular, Express, Node, MongoDB, as well as a number of supporting tools.  Itâ€™s based off https://github.com/sahat/tvshow-tracker, extending it with capabilities to delete items from your database, find shows streaming online if available,  as well as a video game tracker (currently in progress.)

It connects to http://thetvdb.com/ and http://thegamesdb.net/ to get information and artwork.
